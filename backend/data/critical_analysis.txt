The glass tower reflects ambition, but invites no one in.

This staircase climbs, not to a destination, but to a performance of elevation.

The plaza, vast and clean, is a denial of human scale.

A facade that performs openness but conceals control.

Steel and glass shout power louder than any voice inside.
